VIM Plugin for doing a search and replace across many files.

Use :Gsearch <search>  to get a buffer window of your search results
then you can make the replacements inside the buffer window using 
traditional tools (s/foo/bar/) and invoke :Greplace to make your changes.

Modifications by Yan Pritzker:
 * Always grep recursive
 * Silence the search so you don't get a gigantic scroll list
