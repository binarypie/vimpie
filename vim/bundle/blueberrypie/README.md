# Blueberry Pie Color Scheme for Vim

Blueberry Pie is an adaptation from the monokai theme for vim.

The  Vim port of the monokai theme for TextMate originally created by Wimer Hazenberg.

By default, it has a dark gray background based on the version created by Hamish Stuart Macpherson for the E editor. 

256-Color terminals are also supported, though there are some differences with the Gui version. Only the dark gray background style is supported on terminal vim at this time.

## Installation

Just copy the file on your .vim/colors folder.
